    "### Modified Berggren Frost Depth\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "From Bianchini and Gonzalez (2012)<sup>[[6]](#6)</sup>:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The design of pavement structures in cold climates must account for the changes in soil properties due to the influence of freezing and thawing cycles. The calculation of frost depth is a fundamental step during the design and evaluation of pavement structures by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). The DoD uses the modified Berggren (ModBerg) equation to compute the frost penetration depth.\"\n",
    "> \n",
    "The functions provided here compute the ModBerg frost depth in the same fashion as demonstrated in the The Unified Facilities Criteria (UFC) 3-130-06<sup>[[5]](#5)</sup>. Note that other tools (in particular the Pavement-Transportation Computer Assisted Structural Engineering (PCASE)) offer numerical solutions to the ModBerg equation and thus predict different values than the solutions described in the UFC and presented here. See Bianchini and Gonzalez (2012)<sup>[[6]](#6)</sup> for a discussion of those differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thaw depth is not yet implemented.\n",
    "- Frost depth is computed for a single layer of homogenous isotropic soil.\n",
    "- Heat flow is one-dimensional with the entire soil mass at its mean annual temperature prior to the start of the freezing season. The surface temperature changes suddenly as a step function from the mean annual temperature to a temperature v<sub>s</sub> degrees below freezing and remains at this new temperature throughout the entire freezing season.\n",
    "- The coefficient λ considers the effect of the temperature changes in the soil mass and is a function of the fusion parameter μ and thermal ratio α. Traditionally, λ is found \"manually\" by using values of μ and α to consult a chart such as this one from Aldrich and Paynter (1966)<sup>[[3]](#3)</sup>:\n",
    "\n",
    " <img src=\"static/correction_coeff.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Here λ is found using equation _2-33_ from Aldrich (1953)<sup>[[2]](#2)</sup> implemented like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def compute_lambda_coeff(mu, thermal_ratio):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Compute the lambda coefficient (dimensionless).\n",
    "    Args:\n",
    "        mu: the fusion parameter (dimensionless)\n",
    "        thermal_ratio: thermal ratio (dimensionless)\n",
    "    Returns\n",
    "        lc: the lambda coefficient value (dimensionless).\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    lc = 1.0 / (np.sqrt(1 + (mu * (thermal_ratio + 0.5))))\n",
    "    return round(lc, 2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method removes manual consultation of the above figure and should produce coefficients suitable for high latitudes (where the thermal ratio is low), though may overestimate frost depths for more temperate climates.\n",

    "### Usage & Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are a popular tool for interactive computing used by data professionals. Notebooks provide a versatile environment for writing and executing code, creating visualizations, and documenting your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Running Individual Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are organized into cells. Each cell can contain code or text. To run an individual code cell:\n",
    "1. Click on the cell you want to run. The cell will be highlighted.\n",
    "2. Press `Shift + Enter` on your keyboard, or click the \"Run\" button in the toolbar at the top. The code in the cell will execute, and any output (such as printed text or graphs) will be displayed immediately below the cell.\n",
    "3. You can run cells in any order, making it easy to experiment and iterate with your code. Note that the notebook here expects cells to be executed in order to produce the intended results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run all cells in the notebook in sequence:\n",
    "1. Go to the \"Cell\" menu at the top.\n",
    "2. Select \"Run All.\" This will execute all the cells in the notebook from top to bottom.\n",
    "3. Running all cells is useful when you want to ensure that your notebook runs correctly from start to finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Downloading a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to save a local copy of the notebook:\n",
    "1. Go to the \"File\" menu.\n",
    "2. Select \"Download\" - this will save your notebook in the native Jupyter Notebook format (**.ipynb**). and the notebook will be downloaded to your computer.\n",
